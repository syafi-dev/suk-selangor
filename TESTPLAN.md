# TESTPLAN — SUK Selangor Git & GitLab deck

Append-only checklist of scenarios that must keep passing. Verified via
`pnpm build` and `pnpm exec slidev export --format png` (Playwright renders
final-click state faithfully; the Claude Browser preview tab runs `hidden`, so
RAF-driven `v-motion` freezes there — always verify with the PNG export, not
preview-pane screenshots).

## Build & structure

- [x] `pnpm install` succeeds; `pnpm build` exits 0 (671 modules). — 2026-07-21
- [x] `slides.md` imports 40 pages via `src:`; every page file exists. — 2026-07-21
- [x] Build base is `/suk-selangor/`; all `dist/assets/*` reference that base. — 2026-07-21

## Rendering — both color schemes

- [x] Full deck exported to PNG (dark); all 40 slides render, no blank/broken. — 2026-07-21 (check-dark/)
- [x] Light-scheme sample (1,7,8,15,27,31,35,40) renders: dark text on white,
      diagrams switch to light palette, TermWindows stay dark, GUI mocks stay
      light, footer legible. — 2026-07-21 (check-light/)
- [x] Icons resolve: `mdi-*` and `logos-gitlab-icon` render (no empty boxes). — 2026-07-21
- [x] GitGraph (branch-graph, merge-strategies) draws commits/wires/HEAD with
      explicit English props (never the BM Docker defaults). — 2026-07-21
- [x] FlowGraph (four-places, remotes-origin, merge-request-flow) draws nodes,
      edges, and command labels with explicit props. — 2026-07-21

## Layout regressions

- [x] **best-practices (slide 31):** 6-medallion grid must fit above the footer
      in BOTH schemes (regression: original `mt-10`+`gap-y-8`+4.6rem medallions
      overflowed, clipping the bottom row's captions). Fixed with
      `mt-6 gap-y-5` + `!w-14 !h-14` medallions + one-line captions. — 2026-07-21
- [x] **Lab component (Lab 2 & Lab 4):** five-step labs must keep the caution
      strip above the fixed footer (regression: original spacing overflowed and
      the caution collided with the footer). Fixed by tightening medallion/goal/
      step/terminal spacing + font in `Lab.vue`; verified Lab 2 & Lab 4 clear the
      footer in BOTH schemes. — 2026-07-21
- [x] No slide's content overlaps the fixed footer at final click state. — 2026-07-21

## Branding (client deliverable — no design-ref leakage)

- [x] No "Infratify", "Inframesia", "NTW", "National Training", or trainer names
      from the reference repo anywhere in shipped files (grep clean). — 2026-07-21
- [x] Title/footer/closing carry only SUK Selangor + Syafiyullah Yahya
      (MBOT Professional Technologist, github.com/syafi-dev, linkedin.com/in/syafi). — 2026-07-21
- [x] FlowGraph/GitGraph component defaults contain no Bahasa Malaysia strings. — 2026-07-21

## Deploy

- [x] GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes to Pages (no ntw `lint:decks`
      step; single-deck build). — 2026-07-21
- [x] Live at https://syafi-dev.github.io/suk-selangor/ — HTTP 200, correct
      `<title>`, assets on `/suk-selangor/` base, logo + icons load. — 2026-07-21

## Content fidelity

- [x] All 4 parts present with 8 labs (Lab 1–8), pitfalls, recovery clinic,
      cheat sheet, seven habits, pre/post-assessment + feedback links. — 2026-07-21
- [x] Enriched with Mastering concept slides: what-is-git, merge-strategies
      (fast-forward vs 3-way), what-is-gitlab (self-hosted vs SaaS). — 2026-07-21
- [x] Source URLs preserved: ml.my/git-gitlab-slide, pre/post questionnaires,
      feedback form, git.selangor.gov.my practice repo. — 2026-07-21
