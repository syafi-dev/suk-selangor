<!--
- this is a real review cycle, both sides; everyone plays author once and reviewer once
[click] author opens the MR with a small, readable change
[click] reviewer reads the diff and leaves one specific, actionable comment
[click] author responds with a new commit and pushes; the MR updates automatically, no new MR needed
[click] if main moved and GitLab shows a conflict, resolve it exactly like Lab 5
[click] reviewer approves, author merges, branch deleted; cycle complete
- then swap roles; the skill is giving and taking review calmly, which is most of real teamwork
