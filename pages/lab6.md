<!--
- the full MR flow, hands-on; the terminal part is short, most of it happens in the GitLab browser
[click] branch and make one small change so the diff is easy to read
[click] push with -u so the branch links to origin; GitLab prints a ready-made MR link in the output
[click] click Create merge request in GitLab, or follow that printed link
[click] give it a clear title and description, and assign a partner as reviewer
[click] the reviewer leaves a comment, then you merge and delete the branch
- ACTIVITY: authors paste their MR link in the chat; each person opens a partner's and leaves one specific, kind comment
