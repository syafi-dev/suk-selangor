<!--
- two branches at once shows how isolation really works; changes on one never leak into the other
[click] make feature/header off main and commit
[click] make feature/footer, also off main, and commit; note "main" at the end starts it from main not from header
[click] branch lists all three; switch between them and watch the files on disk change to match
[click] merge both into main in turn; each is independent
[click] delete the merged branches with -d to keep the list clean; -d refuses if a branch is unmerged, which is a safety net
- gloss: each branch is a separate desk; switching swaps the papers on your desk to that task's papers
